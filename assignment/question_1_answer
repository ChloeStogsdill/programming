Question 1 Part 3: "Do any of your findings surprise you?"
Answer:
Yes, but not in the way I assume is being asked. While the salaries, work experience, required education, job growth, etc. did not suprise me very much, the website itself did surprise me. Most of the job titles or overarching branches I find myself interested in were not featured on the website at all. Particularly surprising to me was that "Cyber" or "Cybersecurity" did not have any matches. I would have, for how common I find "Cyber" to be a key word to search for when looking for jobs I find interesting, assumed that at least a "Cybersecurity Engineer" or "Cyber Researcher" role have been present on the website.
